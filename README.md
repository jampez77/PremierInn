## Installation through [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/)

There is an active [PR](https://github.com/hacs/default/pull/2719) to get this into [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/), once that is merged then you can install the **Premier Inn** integration by searching for it there in HA instance.

Until then you will have to add this repository manually:

Go to HACS -> 3 dot menu -> Custom Repositories:- 

Paste `https://github.com/jampez77/PremierInn` into Repository field and select `Integration`

Now you should be able to find it in HACS as normal.

You can install the **Premier Inn** integration by searching for it there in HA instance.

## Manual Installation
Use this route only if you do not want to use [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) and love the pain of manually installing regular updates.
* Add the `premierinn` folder in your `custom_components` folder

## Usage

Each entry requires a `booking reference`, `arrival date`, `surname` and the `country` that the hotel is located in. This information can be found on your booking email confirmation. Additionaly you can select an existing calendar and\or ask the integration to create a new one to display date based information such as check in/out times.
